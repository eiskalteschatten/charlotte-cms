  <p>This document focuses exclusively on what types of content may be published on TF Labs.</p>
  <p>In addition to the sitewide Content Guidelines covered in this document, please see our <a href="/documents/submission-guidelines/">Submission Guidelines</a> for additional publishing requirements.</p>
  <p>TF Labs is a diverse open-minded kink-positive community dedicated to the exploration of transformation fantasies in fiction. We support artists' right to create freely. We also acknowledge publishers' right to create a community accommodating to their specific members.</p>
  <p>To that end, we DO NOT publish works of any type featuring the following content:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sexual activity involving characters under the age of 18 (including but not limited to explicit sexual discussion, voyeurism, exhibitionism, fantasizing, masturbation, and graphic sexualized descriptions, in addition to actual sexual intercourse). TF Labs has a strict policy against any under-18 content, and any attempt to violate that policy is grounds for account termination.</li>
    <li>Any material supporting, encouraging, or defending any type of child abuse and/or child exploitation.</li>
    <li>Celebrity stories or fan fiction in which the characters are artificially aged - that is, under 18 years old in reality or in the source material, but made to be over 18 for the story.</li>
    <li>Copyrighted material for which the submitter is not the owner of the copyright, or for which the submitter does not have an explicit license from the copyright owner to publish the work at TF Labs.</li>
    <li>Bestiality - sexual activity between humans and real-life animals will not be published; human sex with fantasy characters, monsters, furries, anthro, etc. are allowed.</li>
    <li>Ravishment, nonconsensual, dubiously consensual, or consensual-nonconsensual fantasies involving real-life people, groups/organizations, or copyrighted characters. TF Labs does not publish non-con fanfic.</li>
    <li>Works that promote or glorify hate, intolerance, or violence towards any person or group.</li>
    <li>Works that promote real (non-fictional) prostitution or sex work. These themes and topics may be used freely in fictional stories, but authors may not promote any real-life sex work services or real-life prostitution services.</li>
    <li>Works that advocate for readers to engage in any real-life (non-fictional) activity that is illegal in the Germany.</li>
    <li>Works professed to be true about real people in the title, tags, and/or description. You can use "true" within the body of a story as part of your fictional storytelling. This policy is to protect authors as well as third parties.</li>
    <li>Works that promote or focus heavily on politics or religion, or political or religious figures.</li>
    <li>Works that contain advertisements, outside links, domain names, or outside promotions of any kind within the description, body text, or audio (including "See my profile for...").</li>
    <li>Works generated by artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLM), or other non-human automated systems. TF Labs publishes works by humans for humans.</li>
    <li>Teasers, partial works, excerpts of offsite works, or any work that appears to be a promotion for other platforms.</li>
    <li>We also reserve the right to reject or remove any content or work that the community finds disruptive (or that causes harm to the community or any member of the community) for any or no reason.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The above guidelines apply to all content published on TF Labs, including but not limited to stories, poems, artworks, comments, feedback, and forum posts.</p>
